Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project focuses on predicting neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Additionally, it extends to predicting diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer. By leveraging machine learning models, the goal is to enhance early detection, optimize care strategies, and contribute to better healthcare outcomes. Early diagnosis of these diseases enables timely intervention, personalized treatment plans, and improved quality of life for patients.

Motivation
Neurodegenerative diseases significantly impact individuals and healthcare systems. With their growing prevalence, early detection becomes crucial for timely intervention. This project aims to empower patients and families to make informed decisions, ultimately leading to better health management and emotional well-being.

Problem Statement
Many diseases are often diagnosed at a late stage when treatment becomes challenging and less effective. Late diagnoses lead to increased healthcare costs and lower treatment success rates. Predictive analytics can address this challenge by identifying diseases early, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing overall healthcare expenses.

Objectives
Enable early detection of neurodegenerative diseases for timely intervention.
Provide risk assessment to support personalized medicine.
Predict disease trends to optimize healthcare resource allocation.
Improve overall healthcare delivery and reduce hospitalizations.
